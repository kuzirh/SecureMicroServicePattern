# Secure Microservice Pattern

Welcome! You seem to have stumbled upon this repo by chance, but thank you for taking a look. This repo is a part of a Capstone project for my Masters of Science in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity. This repo will contain only components of the project that are allowed to be public, and is meant to serve as a reusable pattern for anyone.

## About the Contributor:

My name is Kuzirh, I am a security engineer out of sunny Florida. I have a passion for autiomations and saving people time, as well as write sub-par code. For a long time now I have been wanting to give back to the community, and I have also been wanting to create a secure pattern for deploying microservices to AWS for my own personal projects.

It should be noted that the contents of this repo is of my own work and any code that is used from outside sources shall be [referenced](docs/REFERENCES.md). That being said, this repo is built with open-source in mind, and can be used by anyone!
